# aoc-2020

My solutions to advent of code 2020, in python.

To reproduce the results, create a python 3.8 environment and install the requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run a specific day with e.g.

```
make run day=1
```

and the two results will be printed to the screen, along with the runtime.
To run all the days at once, do

```
make run day=all
```
